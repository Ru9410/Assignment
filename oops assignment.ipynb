Flexibility and Extensibility:\n","\n","- Polymorphism allows you to use the same method name for different object types.\n","\n","- You can extend existing classes (using inheritance) without altering the original code, making it easy to introduce new features.\n","\n","- This leads to flexible systems that can adapt to new requirements.\n","\n","‚úÖ 4. Encapsulation:\n","\n","- Encapsulation keeps the internal state of an object hidden and only exposes a public interface (via methods).\n","\n","- This helps to protect data and ensures that an object‚Äôs internal state is not changed unexpectedly.\n","\n","- It also makes it easier to debug since you can isolate issues within individual objects.\n","\n","‚úÖ 5.
